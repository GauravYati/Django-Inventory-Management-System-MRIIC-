In this project, me and my team have build an inventory management system for Manav Rachna Incubation and Innovation Center. This Project aims to provide the list of items available in MRIIC to all the students in Manav Rachna.
This Project do two main functions:
1. Show all the items available in MRIIC Storage with it's quantity and description.
2. Allow admin to add, remove and update quantity of items present in storage.
